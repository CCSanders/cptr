FRONT-END
- Re-figure out build process for current boilerplate. Do a quick run-through to understand previous progress, things installed, etc.
- Test deploy to iOS device. Figure out basic development process (i.e. will I develop on Windows and test on OSX?)
- Start porting basic Proximity features / screens by hand. 

BACK-END / DB
- Start designing a rough draft of a data model for the GraphQL API
- Initialize the Amplify project / install Amplify global CLI tool 

STUDIO
- Implement a simple color filter, build tool to configure it programatically?
- Reevaluate the need for scriptable JSON filter graph parser / exporter. Would be nice but can also just code graphs by hand in Python using python-ffmpeg.
