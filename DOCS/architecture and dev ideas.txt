two main components:

1) social aspect
infinitely scrollable feed of gif posts that can be loved or commented on
profile shows posts, can follow other profiles or look at a feed

2) gif creation aspect
using native camera libraries
either take small video (2 seconds) and divide it into 6-8 frames or take 6-8 photos over 2 seconds and create looping structure
phhhoto gifs were quite grainy which gave off a very distinct, pleasing aesthetic.
can save to camera roll or post

take video -> send to aws s3 bucket -> have a python lambda layer that converts it into a looping gif (imageio, ffmpeg) -> return to phone??

it would probably be better to do this all on the device so they don't need internet to take the pictures.

ffmpeg has stuff for looping, turning videos and images into gifs, and filtering.
